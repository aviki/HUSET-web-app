          <h2>About Theater Huset</h2>

          <p>The theater house was founded in 2004. After the first Vildskud Theater Festival a need arose to gather the growth theater in Copenhagen, so that all the activities did not run out in the sand when the festival was over. Negotiations were made with the municipality and the Theater House was established as a voluntary public information society.</p>

          <p>We are located in Huset-KBH, but we are our own small unit. Members use the premises to rehearse, experiment and create performances. We have seven rehearsal rooms as well as the Vox & Xenon scenes. Our members create approx. 16 performances a year on stage. Every year in August, we are the setting for the Wildlife Theater Festival. As a member, you can practice with your group in the Theater House, produce a performance, try out theater schools, help create new activities or join steering groups for existing initiatives such as Wildcat & Stagelab.</p>
